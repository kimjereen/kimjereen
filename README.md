### Hi there, I am @kimjereen (Kim Jereen M. Barroquillo)

I'm a student who is new to programming. Nice to meet you!

I started a GitHub account to learn more about the Tech Community and to familiarize myself with how it operates, as I'll become one of them in the future. I'd love to create my own programs one day in order to contribute and share knowledge.


- 👀 I’m interested in Software and Web Development, Digital Designing, Editting and other fun stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying different Programming languages.
- ☕ I'm working on putting together my first ever website.
- 💞️ I'm thrilled to be officially part of this community. 
- 🚀 I will do my best to study hard and further my knowledge in this profession. I'm hoping everything goes smoothly.
