### Hi there! It's me @kimjereen <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

<p align = "justify"> I am Kim, a student. I started a GitHub account to learn more about the Tech Community and to familiarize myself with how it operates, as I'll become one of them in the future. I'd love to create my own programs one day and able to contribute and share knowledge. Nice to meet you! </p>

### About Me:

- 👀 I’m interested in Web Design & Development, UX Design, Editing and other IT stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying IT.
- ☕ I'm working on putting together my first ever website and application.
- 💞️ I'm thrilled to be part of this community.
